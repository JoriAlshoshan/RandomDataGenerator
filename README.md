# RandomDataGenerator

This project is a simple C# console application that allows the user to generate random numbers or random strings.

## Project Idea  
The program allows the user to choose between two options:  
- Generate random numbers within a specific range  
- Generate random strings from selected character types

After choosing the option, the program generates and displays the result.

## Supported Features  

### 1. Random Numbers
- User inputs minimum and maximum values.  
- The program generates a random number between them.

### 2. Random Strings  
- User selects the desired type of characters:  
  - Capital Letters  
  - Small Letters  
  - Numbers  
  - Symbols  

- User specifies the desired length of the string.  
- The program generates a random string of the specified type and length.

## Program Features  
- Interactive console application  
- Simple user-friendly interface  
- Supports generating both random numbers and random strings

## Project Goal  
This project is designed to practice and demonstrate:  
- Working with `Random` in C#  
- Building simple interactive console applications  
- Using string manipulation and `StringBuilder`
